Moreover, neither pre-incubation of cultures with the selective EGFR antagonist, AG1478, nor down-regulation of the EGFR to a point where EGF could no longer activate ERKs had an inhibitory effect on ERK activation by DSLET. These results appear to rule out any structural or catalytic role for the EGFR in the &#x003b4;-opioid-mediated MAPK cascade. To confirm these results, we used C6 glioma cells, a cell line devoid of the EGFR. In &#x003b4;-OR-expressing C6 glioma cells, opioids produce a robust phosphorylation of ERK 1 and 2, whereas EGF has no stimulatory effect. Furthermore, antagonists to the RTKs that are endogenously expressed in C6 glioma cells (insulin receptor (IR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)) were unable to reduce opioid-mediated ERK activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, these data suggest that the transactivation of resident RTKs does not appear to be required for OR-mediated ERK phosphorylation and that the tyrosine-phosphorylated &#x003b4;-OR, itself, is likely to act as its own signalling scaffold.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Opioid receptors (ORs), like many other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are capable of signalling via the family of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs). It has been postulated that activation of these kinases allows GPCR agonists to modulate such diverse molecular events as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. To date, all three cloned opioid receptor types (&#x003bc;,&#x003b4;, &#x003ba;) and the closely related nociceptin receptor have demonstrated the ability to signal through their heterotrimeric G proteins (G<sub>i</sub> or G<sub>o</sub>) to at least one type of MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Among the members of this family that are activated by opioids, are the two extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (p44<sup>MAPK</sup> (ERK 1) and p42<sup>MAPK</sup> (ERK 2)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and the p38 protein kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, the precise mechanism by which OR stimulation produces an increase in MAPK activity is still unknown and under investigation.</p><p>While receptor, cell, and tissue-specific differences almost certainly exist and appear to make any single mechanism of ERK activation unlikely, certain generalities have begun to emerge. For example, ERK activation by GPCRs is predominantly a Ras-dependent event, one that utilizes many of the upstream protein intermediates (i.e. Shc, Gab1, Grb2, mSOS, and MAPK kinase (MEK-1)) known to be used by single-transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) like the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). When ERKs are activated after EGFR stimulation, an essential event is the sequential tyrosine phosphorylation of these intermediate proteins and their binding to the tyrosine phosphorylated EGFR before the GTP-loading of Ras. For the GPCR model, the tyrosine kinase(s) involved and the site of this multi-protein complex formation is less clear. For a number of GPCRs, including the lysophosphatidic acid (LPAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], &#x003b2;-adrenergic<sub>2</sub> (&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-AR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and &#x003bc;- and &#x003b4;-OR receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the activation of a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the Src or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] families are involved. However, the question of what plasma membrane-spanning protein serves as the scaffold for Shc binding and beyond remains to be answered.</p><p>Two possibilities have emerged as potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent scaffold building in response to GPCR stimulation, which results in ERK activation: the GPCR, itself, or a co-expressed RTK (i.e. the EGFR) that would act as a surrogate. We and others and we have reported that &#x003bc;- and &#x003b4;-opioid receptors become tyrosine phosphorylated after agonist-stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Tyrosine phosphorylation of a membrane-bound protein is an essential step in ERK activation, because it creates SH2-binding domains that allow Shc and other proteins to associate into a multi-protein signalling complex. The mutation of one of the tyrosines (Y318F) in the &#x003b4;-OR or the presence of the Src inhibitor, PP1, significantly reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor and its ability to activate ERKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, a small degree of &#x003b4;-OR agonist-mediated ERK activation remained in cells expressing the Y318F mutant receptor, suggesting that a second mechanism or an additional tyrosine could be involved. These data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of GPCRs may allow them to signal ERKs in the absence of RTK or FAK phosphorylation by acting as their own scaffolds.</p><p>However, the majority of the published studies have focused on the hypothesis that GPCRs must work in cooperation with RTKs (i.e. the EGFR) to produce ERK activation. Studies by Daub et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and Luttrell et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have demonstrated that stimulation of LPAR (G<sub>i/q</sub>-coupled) and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-ARs (G<sub>s</sub>-coupled), respectively, results in the "transactivation /transphosphorylation" of co-expressed EGFRs. For example, both EPA and isoproterenol increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, which appears to be required for ERK activation since the presence of kinase-deficient EGFR mutants or the kinase inhibitor, AG1478, prevents both responses. It is hypothesized that trans-tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR creates protein phosphotyrosine binding sites that act as a surrogate scaffold for ERK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Since ORs share many similarities with LPAR and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-ARs in the way they activate the ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we chose to examine whether RTK transactivation occurs and is a necessary aspect of &#x003b4;-opioid-mediated ERK activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>DSLET and EGF induce ERK phosphorylation in &#x003b4;-OR-expressing HEK-293 cells</title><p>We have shown that &#x003b4;-opioids increase the phosphorylation of ERKl/2 in HEK-293 cells when the mouse wild type (WT) &#x003b4;-OR is stably expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The concentrations required to observe DSLET-mediated ERK phosphorylation (EC<sub>50</sub> = 10 nM; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) are consistent with those reported for other &#x003b4;-OR-mediated events, including G protein activation and adenylyl cyclase inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Moreover, no change in total ERK expression was observed, concomitantly, with ERK phosphorylation in any of our experiments (data not shown). Pretreating the cells with PTX (100 ng/ml), or the specific &#x003b4;-OR antagonist, naltrindole (10 &#x003bc;M), completely blocked the DSEET-induced increase in ERK phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). These results suggest that DSLET utilizes a G<sub>i</sub>-coupled &#x003b4;-OR to stimulate ERK 1 and 2. We then took advantage of the HEK-293 cell line's endogenous expression of the EGFR to examine this receptor's ability to activate ERKs. Similar to DSLET, EGF (5 ng/ml) produces a robust activation of ERKs in &#x003b4;-OR-expressing HEK-293 cells after a 5 minute treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). PTX did not attenuate EGF-mediated ERK activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), although this response was completely blocked by the EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478 (1 &#x003bc;M) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Conversely, DSLET-induced ERK activation was unaffected by AG1478, suggesting that different tyrosine kinases are involved in opioid- and EGF-dependent MAPK activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). DSLET-mediated ERK activation was significantly inhibited by the Src kinase inhibitor, PP1 (10 &#x003bc;M) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). PP1 also had a significant inhibitory (75% reduction) effect on MAPK activation by EGF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Western blots characterizing ERK phosphorylation by DSLET.

As stated in the introduction, several GPCRs (including the EPAR, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-AR, and substance P (SP-R)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] increase EGFR phosphorylation during the course of ERK activation, and it is believed, that in these instances, this event is an initial step in the progression of the MAPK cascade. Our laboratory has previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] that 5-opioids induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the &#x003b4;-OR, and it appears that this is catalyzed by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src. However, transphosphorylation of the EGFR after OR activation has not been reported. WT-&#x003b4;-OR-expressing HEK-293 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of either DSLET (1&#x02013;1000 nM) or EGF (0.1&#x02013;100 ng/ml) for five minutes to induce ERK activation. As stated earlier, either DSLET or EGF increased the appearance of phosphorylated ERK in a time and concentration dependent manner. A portion of the lysates used to measure ERK activation was used to immunoprecipitate the EGFR or &#x003b4;-OR to determine their degree of tyrosine phosphorylation. After immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged &#x003b4;-OR or the EGFR with the appropriate antibodies, we found that only DSLET induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the &#x003b4;-OR, whereas only EGF potentiated EGFR phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). 1 &#x003bc;M DSLET-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the &#x003b4;-OR was inhibited by naltrindole, PP1, but not by AG1478 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These results suggest that transactivation of the EGFR does not play a role in &#x003b4;-OR phosphorylation or ERK activation by &#x003b4;-opioids.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Western blots showing the effect of DSLET or EGF on tyrosine phosphorylation of the &#x003b4;-OR or the EGFR.

It is possible that RTKs and GPCRs share important protein intermediates that are required during ERK activation. Therefore, we wished to determine what effects the down-regulation of the EGFR would have on ERK signalling via the &#x003b4;-OR. HEK-293 cells expressing the WT-&#x003b4;-OR were exposed to EGF (100 ng/ml) for 24 hours in order to down-regulate and desensitize the endogenous EGFR. After chronic EGF treatment, the cultures were washed with serum-free media and then exposed acutely (5 minutes) to either EGF (10 ng/ml) or DSLET (1 &#x003bc;M) to stimulate ERK phosphorylation. In EGF pre-treated cultures, acute EGF (10 ng/ml) was unable to increase the expression of phospho-ERKs compared to media-exposed controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This lack of response appears to be due to the down-regulation of EGFRs from these cells as confirmed by immunoblots using the anti-EGFR antibody (data not shown).

Unlike the better understood mechanism whereby single-transmembrane RTKs (e.g. EGFR, IR, or PDGFR) stimulate ERKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], no single sequence of events appears to hold among GPCRs, even when they are expressed in the same cell line. For instance, studies from two laboratories reported marked differences in the way the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-AR) activates ERK 1 and 2 in HEK-293 cells. In one study, the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-AR activates ERK through it's coupling to a PTX-sensitive G<sub>i</sub> protein and subsequent Ras activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], while, in another, ERK phosphorylation occurred in a PTX-independent and a G<sub>s</sub>- and cAMP-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, these studies indicate that the same receptor may activate ERKs via one mechanism when it is endogenously expressed and via another when it is transfected into a cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Despite numerous reported differences, it does appear that diverse GPCRs share common mechanistic themes during ERK stimulation, including the tyrosine-phosphorylation of Shc and its complexing with Grb2, mSOS recruitment, the GTP-loading of Ras, and Raf-1 activation leading to MEK-1 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, the progression of each of these downstream events after GPCR stimulation depends first on the tyrosine phosphorylation of a membrane-bound protein that will be used as a scaffold, which will bind the other proteins (e.g. Shc, Grb2, Gab1, mSOS.... etc...) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the exact identity of the tyrosine kinase(s) involved in this initial step appears to vary among receptor types, with RTKs, non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), or FAKs being involved in particular instances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we questioned whether the EGFR acts as a surrogate scaffold during ERK activation through the &#x003b4;-OR, as it appears to do for several other GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To act as a surrogate-binding site for complex formation, the literature states that this protein must first become tyrosine-phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR is apparent after agonist stimulation of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-AR (COS-7), &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-AR (COS-7), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1; COS-7), substance P, and the lysophosphatidic acid receptor (LPAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, each of the aforementioned ligands also increases ERK phosphorylation when the proper receptor is expressed in these cell lines. ERK activation and EGFR phosphorylation via each of these receptors was inhibited by prior exposure to the EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478.</p><p>However, the Src inhibitor, PP1 or the expression of a dominant-negative Src mutant, will reduce GPCR-mediated transphosphorylation of the EGFR and GPCR-mediated ERK activation to varying degrees (partial to total), suggesting that at least two different tyrosine kinases can be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Src was found to co-immunoprecipitate with the phosphorylated EGFR in COS-7 cells exposed to either LPA or EGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These authors reported that the autophosphorylation of Y350 in the EGFR does not occur after LPA exposure, suggesting that c-Src is the principal tyrosine kinase in this instance and not the EGFR's intrinsic tyrosine kinase. Src has also been found to co-immunoprecipitate with the agonist-stimulated &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-AR during the period of ERK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] suggested that a Src-like protein tyrosine kinase was primarily responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the &#x003b4;-OR and ERK activation induced by DTLET when the receptor was expressed in CHO or HEK-293 cells, because both responses were blocked by the presence of 50 &#x003bc;M PP1. The seemingly dominant role of Src in opioid-mediated ERK stimulation is strengthened in the present report because of considerable evidence that the EGFR antagonist, AG1478, was unable to reduce DSLET-mediated ERK activation. This suggests that the EGFR has minimal, if any, involvement in the opioid-activated ERK cascade. It is possible, that the dual coupling of the LPAR to both inhibitory (G<sub>i</sub>) and stimulatory (G<sub>12/13</sub> and G<sub>q</sub>) G proteins is a reason for these differences.</p><p>In this report, we have presented considerable evidence that &#x003b4;-ORs and EGFRs activate ERKs, independently, without the need for transphosphorylation of a co-expressed RTK. We used C6 glioma cells, transfected to stably express the mouse &#x003b4;-OR, to examine ERK activation by &#x003b4;-opioids in a line that does not express the EGFR to confirm our results obtained in the receptor down-regulation experiments. We observed that DSLET activated p42<sup>mapk</sup> and p44<sup>mapk</sup> very robustly in this cell line. C6 glioma cells do express growth factor receptors that bind PDGF and insulin. However, neither of these proteins has been reported to act as a surrogate scaffold during ERK activation by non-opioid GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the present report, DSLET-mediated ERK phosphorylation was unaltered by the presence of the IR or PDGFR antagonists, HNMPA-(AM)<sub>3</sub> and tyrosphostin 9, respectively. It is probable that the &#x003b4;-OR in C6 glioma cells also acts as its own platform for the binding of Shc, etc., since the &#x003b4;-OR also undergoes agonist-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in this particular cell line (Kramer et al., unpublished observations), similar to what we previously reported for the &#x003b4;-OR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary or HEK-293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, in at least two different cell lines, HEK-293 and C6 glioma, we have significant evidence that transactivation of an endogenously expressed RTK is not required for ERK activation through opioid receptors.</p><p>While the EGFR does not appear to be phosphorylated during DSLET-mediated ERK activation, it is possible that the EGFR is somehow involved in this response when it is present. Buist et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] reported that endogenously-expressed LPA and endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptors in SK-N-MC cells do not activate ERKs unless the EGFR is co-expressed, although each GPCR is functional as evidenced by their ability to increase intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. In the presence of the EGFR, ligand activation of LPA and ET-1 receptors did not increase EGFR phosphorylation even though both the LPA and ET-1 receptors stimulated ERK activity by 10-fold over basal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Specifically, key protein intermediates may be physically associated with endogenous RTKs in HEK-293 cells, and therefore, down-regulation of the EGFR may negatively affect ERK phosphorylation by opioids. To examine this, we induced significant down-regulation of EGFR density and function by exposing &#x003b4;-OR-HEK-293 cells to 100 ng/ml EGF for 24 hours. Functionally, these cells are no longer capable of activating ERK 1 or 2 in response to 10 ng/ml EGF (Figure), whereas this concentration produces a strong effect in non-pretreated cells. Conversely, DSLET-mediated ERK phosphorylation is actually greater in chronically-treated EGF cultures to that observed in cells not previously exposed to high EGF concentrations. This may represent a compensatory effect to counteract the loss of function of an important growth factor receptor. In a similar experiment, a 24-hour exposure to DSLET (10 &#x003bc;M) induced significant &#x003b4;-OR down-regulation and an almost complete loss of DSLET-mediated ERK phosphorylation. MAP kinase activation by a 5 minute exposure to EGF was unaffected by &#x003b4;-OR down-regulation. These results, taken together, suggest that GPCRs and RTKs can act as independent regulators of MAP kinase cascades, although interactions between the two receptor types may exist in certain cases.</p><p>In conclusion, we report that the &#x003b4;-OR agonist, DSLET, induces significant ERK activation in the absence of any increase in phosphorylation of the co-expressed EGFR in HEK-293 cells. HEK-293 cells endogenously express the EGFR, and EGF produces robust ERK activation concomitant with EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that the &#x003b4;-OR becomes tyrosine phosphorylated after exposure to DSLET, but not to EGF. These studies were repeated in &#x003b4;-OR-transfected C6 glioma cells, which do not express the EGFR. In these cells, DSLET was still able to induce ERK activation. Additional studies showed that the two RTKs, which are present in C6 glioma cells, IRs and PDGFRs, had no apparent role on ERK activation by a &#x003b4;-opioid agonist. Furthermore, inducing down-regulation of either the EGFR or &#x003b4;-OR by chronic agonist treatment has little effect on ERK activation by the other receptor in HEK-293 cells, suggesting that these pathways are distinct. These results demonstrate that opioid-mediated ERK activation occurs independently of EGFR transphosphorylation, and that the tyrosine-phosphorylated &#x003b4;-OR may serve as the primary scaffold.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Drugs and compounds</title><p>All chemicals used for these studies were of reagent grade and obtained from the following sources.
